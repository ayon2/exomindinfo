        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction. Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision. AI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of weak AI. Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human cognitive abilities. When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system is able to find a solution without human intervention.<br>

        <b>How does it work?</b><br>
        <br>
        Artificial intelligence can currently function and be created in a multitude of different ways, the most common of which are:<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Machine learning</b> automates analytical model building. It uses methods from neural networks, statistics, operations research and physics to find hidden insights in data without explicitly being programmed for where to look or what to conclude.</li>
          <li>A <b>neural network</b> is a type of machine learning that is made up of interconnected units (like neurons) that processes information by responding to external inputs, relaying information between each unit. The process requires multiple passes at the data to find connections and derive meaning from undefined data.</li>
          <li><b>Deep learning</b> uses huge neural networks with many layers of processing units, taking advantage of advances in computing power and improved training techniques to learn complex patterns in large amounts of data. Common applications include image and speech recognition.</li>
          <li><b>Advanced algorithms</b> are being developed and combined in new ways to analyze more data faster and at multiple levels. This intelligent processing is key to identifying and predicting rare events, understanding complex systems and optimizing unique scenarios.</li>
          <li><b>The Internet of Things</b> generates massive amounts of data from connected devices, most of it unanalyzed. Automating models with AI will allow us to use more of it.</li>
        </ul>
      <p id='para'>
        <br>
        <b>Where is it found?</b><br>
        <br>
        Currently, artificial intelligence can be found in a multitude of locations, the more advanced intelligences are being used by higher power entities such as the government while lower power intelligences can be found anywhere from a video game to a smart home device. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Who is currently working on it?</b><br>
        <br>
        Volkswagen (Self Driving Car) JPMorgan Chase (Banking) Philips (Healthcare) Panasonic (Computer Vision) Palo Alto Networks (Cybersecurity) Affectiva (Emotion Detection) Deeplearning.ai (Training), and of course ExoMind (Everything)!<br>
